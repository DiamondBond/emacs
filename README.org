* Preview

The entire config file can be viewed [[https://diamondbond.neocities.org/emacs.html][here]] in HTML format.

* Installation

Clone this repo:

#+begin_src sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/diamondbond/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d --recurse-submodules
#+end_src

Install:

#+begin_src sh
  $ cd ~/git/emacs
  $ chmod +x install.sh
  $ ./install.sh
#+end_src

NOTE: Make sure you set your global variables in the =userconfig.org= file in the =.emacs.d= directory.

** Icons

If you care about fancy icons, install the fonts provided by [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all the icons]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
#+end_src

** Syntax checking/linting

Most IDE-like features are provided by the [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP]] package. For it to work properly, you need to install the appropriate [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#supported-languages][language servers]].

** Post setup

Please refer to [[https://github.com/DiamondBond/emacs/blob/master/config.org#post-setup][the post setup documentation]] to fully configure everything.

** Customization

Edit the =userconfig.org= file in the =.emacs.d= directory and add your custom settings there (in "emacs-lisp" org-mode code blocks).

You may also edit the =config.org= file directly, but your custom settings might be wiped out in case of an update.
