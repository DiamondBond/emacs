* Introduction
A sensible Emacs distro aimed at enhancing the default experience.

* Quick Start

Install [[https://github.com/DiamondBond/emacs/blob/master/docs/emacsfromsource.org][Emacs@Head]].

Clone this repository to =~/.emacs.d= or =~/.config/emacs=:

#+caption: Command to clone this Emacs distros =git= repository.
#+name: li#git_clone
#+begin_src sh

  git clone https://github.com/diamondbond/emacs ~/.emacs.d

#+end_src

* Principles

This configuration and all associated modules intend to follow the below priniciples.

** Performant

Provides a responsive experience that adheres to function over form principles.

** Reproducible

Utilizes straight.el for reproducibility & increased stability.

** Literate

Provides verbose doc-strings.

** Correct

Aggressively utilizes best practices.

Where possible, we will leverage built-in Emacs functionality instead of external packages.

** Modular

The base configuration only sets up Emacs to have a cleaner presentation with sensible defaults.

The implication is that someone should be able to install or copy code from this configuration into their own configuration or vice versa.

* Modules

This list is in chronological load order.

- [[file:early-init.el][early-bootstrap]] :: Early bootstrap

This is a community-run modular Emacs configuration, for which we appreciate
feedback in the form of issues and pull requests. Feel free to open an issue
prior to opening a pull request if you're not certain your idea is in the spirit
of the [[https://github.com/diamondbond/emacs/blob/master/README.org#principles][Principles]].

** Contributing Tips for Elisp

   + Provide verbose doc-strings for =defvar=, =defcustom=, =defun=, =defmacro=,
     etc to clearly document what is going on.
   + Make sure to follow doc-string guidelines (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Documentation Tips]] or [[info:elisp#Documentation
     Tips][elisp#Documentation Tips]])
   + Add comments for blocks of code, especially to describe /why/ the code is
     present, or the intention. These comments serve as documentation when
     reading the code where a doc-string is not an option.
   + Add or update documentation in the /docs/ folder. Especially for new
     modules, please provide the info file with your PR. (see [[file:docs/CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing Documentation]])
   + If your PR addresses an issue, whether it closes or fixes the issue, or is
     just related to it, please add the issue number in your commit message or
     the description of your PR so they can be linked together.

** Contributing Tips for Issues

   We welcome your questions and ideas, please open an issue if you have one!

   + If you feel there is a defect with what we provide, please provide the
     steps necessary to reproduce the issue. A minimal configuration, a link to
     your configuration, or a gist/pastebin link or similar is appreciated to
     help us work toward a solution together.
   + If you feel there is a missing feature, please describe your feature in as
     much detail as possible so we understand your request.
   + If you have a question, be as specific as possible so we can understand how
     to help you as best we can.
   + PRs to address any of the issues you might raise are appreciated and
     encouraged! If you don't provide one, please be patient with us, it may
     take longer to fix an issue or provide a missing feature. That being said,
     please feel free to check on the status of issues from time to time if it
